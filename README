This is a tool that allows the user to change instruments in a MIDI file on a per-channel basis.

WHY?
    Because nobody likes Choir Aahs.

HOW?
    By modifying all Program Change events according to the user's input.

FOR WHOM?
    Mostly for myself, but should be useful to many people who want to change instruments in a quicker and "cleaner" way than through Finale/Sibelius/similar. Unlike this tool, they parse MIDI file to their internal representation as an intermediate step, which means you might make more changes to your MIDI file than those you intended to.

LIMITATIONS
    Only one instrument per channel for the entire duration of the file.

BUGS
    Some instrument names may not exactly match the list below.

POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS
    Not all MIDI file contain Program Change events at all. Add a boolean option to insert such events at the start of each track.

BUILDING
    Who really knows the right way to build with cabal? I do it like this:
    cabal sandbox init
    cabal install --dependencies-only
    cabal build

    You can probably use stack instead, if you prefer. I bet it's easier.

USAGE
    change-instrument [OPTIONS] FILE...

OPTIONS
    -o OUTFILE
        Save output in OUTFILE. This option is mandatory.
    -c "(CH, INSTR)"
        Change the instrument of channel CH to INSTR. See below for format of INSTR. This option can be given multiple times.
    -d INSTR
        Specify the default instrument for use with -s. Has no effect without -s. See below for format of INSTR.
    -s
        Change all channels (except any specified with -c) to the same instrument. Defaults to Acoustic Grand Piano, but see -d.

EXAMPLES
    change-instrument -o "Joyful piano.mid" -s Joyful.mid
        Change all instruments in Joyful.mid to Acoustic Grand Piano.
    change-instrument -c "(0, Recorder)" -c "(1, 56)" -c "(2, Oboe)" -c "(3, 42)" -s -o "Kul jul.mid" "Jul jul.mid"
        Change channels 0-3 to the instruments Recorder, Trumpet, Oboe and Cello, and any other channels to Acoustic Grand Piano.
